 * Represents a directory entry.
 *
 * A directory entry has two independent state conditions:
 *
 * - An InodeBase object for the entry may or may not exist. If it does
 *   exist, it is the authoritative source of data for the entry. If not, the
 *   type of the entry can be retrieved, but to read or update its contents or
 *   inode metadata, the InodeBase must be loaded.
 *
 * - The child may or may not be materialized in the overlay.
 *   If the child contents are identical to an existing source control Tree
 *   or Blob then it does not need to be materialized, and the Entry may only
 *   contain the id identifying the Tree/Blob. If the entry is materialized,
 *   no id is set and the entry's materialized contents are available in the
 *   Overlay under the entry's inode number.
